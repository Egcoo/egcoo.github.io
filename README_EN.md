## Planned Actions

- [ ] **Reconstruct the website using Vue.js and update the design**: Migrate the existing website to the Vue.js framework and use its powerful componentization and responsiveness capabilities to improve the performance and maintainability of the website. The user interface has been redesigned with a focus on user experience and modern visuals.
- [ ] **Introducing Next.js to rewrite the website**: Use the Next.js framework to re-implement the website, taking advantage of its componentization and virtual DOM features to improve website performance and development efficiency.
- [ ] **Introduce a Responsive Framework**: Consider migrating your existing website to a modern responsive framework such as Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for better cross-device compatibility and accessibility.
- [ ] **Develop browser plugin**: Create a browser plug-in that allows users to easily access the website navigation page and quickly open links in a new tab or sidebar.
- [ ] **Supports drag-and-drop and sorting**: Implement drag-and-drop functionality, allowing users to reorder and organize their website navigation by dragging links.
